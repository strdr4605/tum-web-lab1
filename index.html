      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Hey. I am Max, a dedicated software engineer with 2+ years of experience in creating digital solutions. In my work I prefer to go with 1 h of thinking / 10 mins of coding, as I am always thinking that a good solution is a well-thought solution.
        I am always learning, even now while writing this description I am learning, as I think that learning is the path to constant growth both personally and in career.
        P.S: A minor detail about me: My mom calls me "Maxim" when angry, so please don't call me "Maxim"
