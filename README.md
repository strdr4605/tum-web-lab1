## Create your Resume page

Create an HTML page representing your CV/Resume that you will send to your desired opened job position.

The page should have multiple sections:

- Basic information such as Name, Surname, contact details,
- A personal or professional description of 2-3 sentences, for example: "I enjoy drawing..., I aspire to become a specialized front-end programmer..."
- Education (School, College)
  - For each point in education, add information about a favorite course or a pleasant memory.
- Projects that you worked on.
  - Link to the projects, and technologies used.
- (Any other section you believe is necessary)

Use HTML tags that you think are relevant.

Use this template as your first Pull Request "Add basic index.html".

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <title>Your Name - CV/Resume</title>
  </head>
