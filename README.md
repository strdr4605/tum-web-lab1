- A personal or professional description of 2-3 sentences, for example: "I enjoy drawing..., I aspire to become a specialized front-end programmer..."
- Education (School, College)
  - For each point in education, add information about a favorite course or a pleasant memory.
- Projects that you worked on.
  - Link to the projects, and technologies used.
- (Any other section you believe is necessary)

Use HTML tags that you think are relevant.
